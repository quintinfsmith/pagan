## What is it?
Pagan is a music sequencer built around 2 main features:

    1. N-tone tuning. I was curious to see what was possible and what musical vocabulary could develop around different sized octaves.
    2. Beat-centric visualization. No more time signatures or measures.

Essentially, it exists because I wanted to be able to write music in a way that represents how I look at music rather than try to translate musical ideas to and from a different structure, like a game of broken telephone.
It may be for you, it may not. You do you.

### Manual Build
The `master` branch should always be the most stable. I use android studio to build and if you don't, you probably don't need any direction from me.

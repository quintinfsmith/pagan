- Can mute channels and lines without modifying volume controls. (thanks to Addie Volynska for the suggestion)
- Added JSON to export menu. (same behavior as long-pressing save button)
- Double-clicking effect control labels will select channel like double-clicking standard line labels.
- When a project is loaded, the soundfont will automatically change to the the soundfont that was in use when a project was saved.

- Bugfix: Swapping lines sometimes not updating line labels correctly
- Bugfix: Crash when setting relative value below 0

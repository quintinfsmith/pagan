Pagan is a music sequencer tailored to mobile devices. It uses a simplistic but self-evident notation scheme to save vertical space.
Pagan was created with the intent of being able to quickly jot down a tune then come back and work on it at your own pace rather than getting out your instruments or booting up an entire DAW.
